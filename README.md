- Geoff Lloyd - Software Developer
- Software Developer and Freelance Audio Engineer with a background in Music Education, Vocal Jazz, Feminist Theory, Post-Colonial Theory, Media Studies, and Philosophy. Promoter of critical thinking, education, and intersectionality, constantly looking for new things to learn and new ways to see the world. Current things I've been chewing on is looking at how games and technology frame how we interact with the world around us and how we might embrace that for furthering education in ethics, sociology, and philosophy.
